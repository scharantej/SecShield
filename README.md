## Flask Application Design

**HTML Files:**

- **index.html**: The main page of the application will display a list of options such as software development, testing, and deployment.
- **software_development.html**: This page will provide information about secure software development practices, such as secure coding guidelines, code reviews, and threat modeling.
- **testing.html**: This page will cover secure testing practices, including static analysis, dynamic analysis, and penetration testing.
- **deployment.html**: This page will discuss secure deployment practices, such as secure configuration management, infrastructure security, and monitoring.

**Routes:**

- **/@**: - This route will serve the **index.html** page.
- **/software_development**: - This route will serve the **software_development.html** page.
- **/testing**: - This route will serve the **testing.html** page.
- **/deployment**: - This route will serve the **deployment.html** page.
- **/test_of_design**: - This route will perform the test of design and operating effectiveness criteria against each security control.

**Test of Design and Operating Effectiveness Criteria:**

For each security control, the following criteria will be tested:

**Design:**

- **Control is properly designed to address the security risk.**
- **Control is implemented in a way that is consistent with the design.**
- **Control is integrated with other security controls in a way that provides comprehensive protection.**

**Operating Effectiveness:**

- **Control is operating effectively to prevent or mitigate the security risk.**
- **Control is being monitored and maintained in a way that ensures its continued effectiveness.**

**Flask Implementation of Testing:**

The **@test_of_design** route will implement the following code:

```python
@app.route('/test_of_design', methods=['GET'])
def test_of_design():
    # Read the test criteria from a file or database
    # Iterate through the criteria and test each control
    # Save the test results to a file or database
    # Return a summary of the test results
    pass
```
